# PCA and Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the breast cancer dataset and implements logistic regression to predict the presence of cancer. The script includes user prompts for calling different functions and ensures each step is performed correctly.
